🎓 About This Project

I developed RealtyAI as part of my AI/ML learning journey. This is a complete web-based real estate intelligence platform that uses multiple machine learning models for property analysis.

🎯 Learning Objectives Achieved:

· CNN Model - For satellite image classification
· XGBoost Model - For accurate price prediction
· LSTM Model - For time-series price forecasting
· Streamlit Framework - Building interactive web interfaces
· End-to-End Pipeline - From data processing to deployment
· User Authentication - Secure login system implementation

🚀 Project Highlights:

· Multi-Model Integration: Combined 3 different ML models into single platform
· Real-World Application: Practical solution for real estate market analysis
· Professional UI: Modern, responsive design with interactive elements
· Full-Stack Development: Frontend + Backend + Database + ML integration
· Cloud Deployment: Experience with Streamlit Cloud and Google Colab deployment

📚 Technologies Learned & Applied:

· Frontend: Streamlit, HTML/CSS, JavaScript
· Backend: Python, Flask-like architecture
· ML/DL: TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn, XGBoost
· Database: SQLite with secure authentication
· DevOps: GitHub, Streamlit Cloud, ngrok tunneling
· Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy, OpenCV, Pillow

This project demonstrates my ability to conceptualize, develop, and deploy a complete AI-powered web application from scratch. It combines theoretical ML knowledge with practical software engineering skills to solve real-world problems in the real estate domain.
